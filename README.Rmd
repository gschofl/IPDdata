# IPDdata

An R data package that provides a snapshot of the IPD-IMGT/HLA and IPD-KIR
database for use with `DR2S`.

Data are provided as `HLAGene` object as defined in the package `HLAtools`.

Git tags refer to the IPD-IMGT/HLA release that is encapsulated in the
`HLAGene` objects.

## Usage

`IPDdata` provides one function `loadIPDdata(locus)`:

```{r}
library(IPDdata)
x <- loadIPDdata("DPB1")
x
```
